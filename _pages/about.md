I am a DAAD Graduate Scholarship Awardee doing my doctoral studies at [Georg-August Universität, Göttingen](https://www.uni-goettingen.de/en/1.html) under [Dr. Chenchang Zhu](https://www.uni-math.gwdg.de/zhu/). I am also an associated member of the Research Training Group ([RTG-2491](https://www.uni-goettingen.de/de/607635.html)) on Fourier Analysis and Spectral theory. Previously, I worked as a Guest lecturer in Mathematics at Govt. Polytechnic College, Ezhukone from October 2021 to July 2022.

I completed my Integrated Bachelors-Masters of Science in Mathematical Science from [IISER Thiruvananthapuram](https://www.iisertvm.ac.in) with a minor in Biological sciences. I did my Master's thesis on Higher Lie groupoids and associated Stacks with [Dr. Saikat Chatterjee](https://www.iisertvm.ac.in/faculty/saikat/personal).
